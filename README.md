## Template for Python Projects 

### Goal
Prepare a Python template for the future use of the data engineering course, or other Python projects.


### Setting up the Project
* Makefile: Rules for building the system. Use `make` to run the commands.
* requirements.txt: Specifies the package used by the program. Used by Makefile for installation `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* .github/workflow: contains the cicd.yml file which set up the CI process. When push or merge to the main branch, a GitHub Action will be triggered running install, lint, test, format, and deploy
